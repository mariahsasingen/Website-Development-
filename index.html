                  <h1 class="hero-header">What Is Online Learning?</h1>
                  <p>Online learning, which can also be said as eLearning, is one of the teaching and learning techniques where the internet is the main component here. It gathers the students and their teachers together through software platforms that allow them to communicate, face, share, and interact with each other by using the technology devices, such as mobile phones, laptops, computers, tablets, and other considerable devices. Furthermore, online learning is a form of distance learning in which education makes use of internet technology enhancement.

                  <h1 class="hero-header">Is Online Learning Essential?</h1>
                  <p>While reading the above question, millions of ‘OF COURSE’ pop up in each and every reader’s mind for sure (at least, it is 95% applicable nowadays). Online education gives teaching and learning activities flexibility without worrying about external issues. Recount the worldwide, COVID-19 pandemic. Students were at loss in gaining education, teachers were threatened with their jobs, and educational attainment was at risk. However, the presence of the internet provides online learning, eradicating the above problems – even though it is not entirely solved.

                  <h1 class="hero-header"> How Is It Implemented?</h1>
                  <p>Online learning implementation is as simple as a teacher meeting or interacting with their students through different software platforms that they wish to use. The limitation of this is only they cannot do activities by being present together in the same place, but other than that, chatting through texts, chatting through calls, seeing each other through video calls, exchanging information, reading books, and many more fun activities can be done virtually through online learning. </p>

    <p>"eLearning is a form of distance education that allows teachers and students to connect through online platforms. It provides flexibility and is essential during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The history of eLearning dates back to 1953, and it has continued to grow over the years. To conduct eLearning, good internet connectivity, a computer or mobile device, and headphones are needed. Various online platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Google Classroom, and Zoom are available for eLearning. eLearning offers many advantages, such as flexibility and access to learning resources, but it also has disadvantages, including distractions and technology issues."
